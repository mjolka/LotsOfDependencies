This repository contains a solution that will cause NuGet restore to exhibit a
bug related to its traveral of the dependency graph to extract NoWarn
properties. NuGet restore runs for
 several minutes before failing with an
OutOfMemoryException.

Run

```
NuGet.exe restore src\LotsOfDependencies.sln
```
or
```
dotnet restore src\LotsOfDependencies.sln
```

The contents of `src` are generated by `create.ps1`.
